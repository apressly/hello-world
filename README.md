First Hello World Repo

Ali Here, 
I was a programmer /developer/ creator at one point but "they" took me and wiped my memory. Luckily for me I found my way back but I am starting over and learning what I have lost. I seek guidance, patience and look forward to collaborating and meeting new innovaters like myself. I don't remember those on this path from the past so all I can do is look forward and rejoice at what is to come!
